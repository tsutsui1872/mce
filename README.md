A Minimum CMIP Emulator (MCE) is a simplified climate model that mimics an ensemble of state-of-the-art, full-scale complex climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP). It is intended to emulate time series of several key variables, such as effective radiative forcing and global-mean temperature response, from individual CMIP models with sufficient accuracy. Main use includes diagnosing forcing and response parameters of CMIP models and conducting probabilistic climate projections that reflect multi-model variations.

This release contains Python programs and associated data with the emulator as well as Jupyter notebooks to demonstrate typical usage. The programs consist of core modules and specific scripts for several tasks. The core modules provide computing effective radiative forcing of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and temperature response to changes in the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. The specific scripts perform tasks for preprocessing CMIP models' output and diagnosing their forcing-response parameters. The preprocessing has two steps: global averaging and anomaly computing. The associated data include a set of diagnosed parameters for, currently, 25 models from CMIP phase 5 (CMIP5) and 22 models from phase 6 (CMIP6). Preprocessed CMIP data are provided from different repositories depending on the license of each model output.
